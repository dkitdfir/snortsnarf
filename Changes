------------------------------------------------------
+ Updated parsing for Snort 1.9.0 full alert files

+ -dns now takes an argument, an network address within IP addresses will be
resolved (you might set this to your local network to have these addresses
look up quickly) [contrib by Russell Fulton]
+ better warnings when an input file does not exist, is length 0, or could
not be opened
+ earliest/latest times (printed on the top of pages) can now be shown in

involvement breakdown summaries (N adjustable with -top=N; default 20)
(multiply requested feature)

+ signature list now sorted primarily by priority # unless -sortsigcount1st is
given (-rs still reverses listing order) (use -hiprioisworse if a higher
priority number means a higher priority to you)
+ new -minprio=P option causes alerts with priority lower than P to be ignored;
this could be used to filter out informational messages for a run

+ updated port lookup URL since the old one stopped working
+ added -rs option to reverse the normal sorting of signatures on the
signature index page so that the most active is first
