Description: Example SISR mail template (please modify)

To: $semails
Cc: $creatoremail
Bcc: "Hidden recipient" <nobody@nowhere>
From: $creatoremail
Subject: Activity from $sip (incident $name)

Customize this template for your report.  You define arbitrary headers above and this body is arbitrary.  To reference a field in this body or in the headers, prefix the name of the field with a dollar sign.  For a literal dollar sign, use "$$".  To get at a environmental variable from the form submission (not sure why you'd want to), prefix the name with a percent sign.  For a literal percent, use "%%".

This next part of this example simply lists the fields available by default and their values.

This text is wrapped at 75 columns when you send it, but long words (separated by whitespace, commas and semicolons) such as URLs are never split.

Kind regards,
